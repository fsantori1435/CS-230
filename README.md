# CS-230

The client for this project was The Gaming Room, a company focused on interactive entertainment and game development. They requested the design of a cross-platform game application called Draw It or Lose It. The core requirements were to develop a scalable, web-based game that could run on multiple platforms, including web browsers, mobile devices, and potentially consoles, while managing high-resolution image assets efficiently and securely. The application needed to support user accounts, team and player structures, and include monetization options such as in-game purchases.



One thing I did particularly well in developing this documentation was translating technical requirements into clear design strategies. I focused on aligning system architecture, memory and storage management, and security with the client’s needs. I also effectively used object-oriented principles in my domain modeling, showing how inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction would structure the application logically and efficiently.



Working through the design document was especially helpful in planning before writing code. It encouraged me to think through the system architecture, data flows, and potential issues, such as load balancing, security risks, and user experience, before implementation. This planning process provided a clear blueprint that would reduce trial-and-error during development and improve overall code quality.



If I were to revise one part of my work, I would improve the visual elements of the domain model. While the UML class relationships were well thought out, the graphical representation could be enhanced for clarity. Using a diagramming tool to better illustrate relationships between entities like User, Game, Team, and Player would make the design more accessible to stakeholders and developers alike.



Interpreting the user’s needs was central to my design approach. I considered how players would interact with the game and what technical features were needed to support a smooth, secure experience. Designing with the user in mind ensures the final product is functional, intuitive, and enjoyable. Ignoring user needs can result in a technically sound system that fails to meet real-world expectations.



In designing the software, I followed a modular and service-oriented approach, starting with clear separation of concerns and using a client-server architecture. Moving forward, I would continue to apply strategies such as iterative design, prototyping, and user feedback integration. Additionally, I’d use agile development principles to ensure flexibility throughout the development cycle, making it easier to adapt to changing requirements or feedback.
